# Assimalign OGraph
A company of rag-tag team members building open-source solutions in .NET and JavaScripts.

Inspired by [OData (github.com)](https://github.com/OData), Graph Theory, and [ChilliCream's (github.com)](https://github.com/ChilliCream) GraphQL framework, OGraph is an open source protocol built over HTTP intended to provide the ability to query data similarly to GraphQL while maintaining REST. Similar to OData's implementation of EDM (Entity Data Model) OGraph utilizes Graph Data Modeling to expose data structures.
