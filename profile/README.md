# Assimalign OGraph

Inspired by [OData (github.com)](https://github.com/OData), Graph Theory, and [ChilliCream's (github.com)](https://github.com/ChilliCream) GraphQL framework, OGraph is an open source protocol built over HTTP intended to provide the ability to query data similarly to GraphQL while maintaining REST. Similar to OData's implementation of EDM (Entity Data Model) OGraph utilizes Graph Data Modeling to expose data structures. By utilizing DDD (Domain-Driven Design) users can focus on modeling the domain model rather than the data model.


> **DISCLAIMER!**
> Currently OGraph is in an experimental phase. Design implementations and API changes are still in flight and could be subject to breaking changes. Use with discretion. 
> 
> Further more, Assimalign only utilizes the unified .NET. So no versions prior to .NET 6 will be supported.
